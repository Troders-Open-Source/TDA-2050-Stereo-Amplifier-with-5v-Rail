# TDA2050-STEREO-AMPLIFIER-WITH-5V-RAIL
TDA2050 BASED STEREO AMPLIFIER WITH 5V RAIL. SINGLE SUPPLY(12V) CIRCUIT BASED ON DATASHEET.
THIS IS MY FIRST REPOSITORY. APOLOGIES FOR ANY MISTAKE. KINDLY GIVE FEEDBACK SO THAT I CAN IMPROVE. 
I WILL BE REGULARILY UPDATING THE PCB ACCORDING TO TEST RESULTS. ALL PCB DESIGN WILL BE AVAILABLE STARTING WITH V1.2. THERE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE IN V1.1, HENCE IT WAS REMOVED.
I DESIGNED THIS CIRCUIT FOR PERSONAL USE. THIS IS DESIGNED TO RUN WITH A 12V BATTERY. IT IS PREFERRED THAT SINGLE LAYER PCB SHOULD BE USED. THE PCB REQUIRES ONLY 1 JUMPER WIRE. THE CIRCUIT DIAGRAM AND PCB DESIGN CAN BE CHANGED USING EASYEDA. LINK OF THE EASYEDSA PROJECT: https://easyeda.com/curious_harshit/TDA2050-Stereo-Amplifier . USE THIS LINK TO DIRECTLY OPEN ALL IN EDITOR: https://easyeda.com/editor#id=|d50b4ff4365740bd827232eeae07d1ef|fc7dea0770f04a4bae2d98a7a22d95ce 

KINDLY REFER TO DATASHEET TO CHANGE COMPONENT VALUES. TDA2050 DATASHEET:https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/cd00000131.pdf
ANY VOLTAGE REGULATOR CAN BE USED. IN THIS PROJECT I AM GOING WITH LM7805. LM7805 DATASHEET: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm340.pdf

ALL SUGGESTIONS ARE ACCEPTED.
